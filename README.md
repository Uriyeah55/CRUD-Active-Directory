# PowerShell-Active-Directory

<h3> Goal </h3>

The Script uses PowerShell to access a local Active Directory and manage its users. It features a CRUD with improvements to be made, like the ability to filter users
based on attributes or groups.

<h4> Cleaning and improvements </h4>

As my first project ever with  PowerShell, it lacks functions as they resulted unexpectedly more diferent from other languages than I would like. However, I'm happy with
the result as it performs the wished actions.
Another goal to be added is to build a Java layer above and to implement an interface to make it more usable. I know it in the end I'm only mimicking Windows Active Directory itself, but it has been a great exercise so far.
